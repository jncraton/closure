Closures
========

This lab requires rewriting the `Car` class as a function factory using the closure pattern. You may not use the `class` keyword in your submission, and no code outside of the Car function needs to be modified.

When your solution is working, all tests will pass, and you will see three "cars" race in the terminal.

Running

This is a JS program that can be run in nodejs:
